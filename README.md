## Project Description:

The project focuses on a simple demonstration of client-server communication via User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is implemented in Unity3D. More precisely, it is the control of the robot by EGM (Externally Guided Motion). The application uses performance optimization using multi-threaded programming.

The 3D parts of the robot were downloaded from the official ABB website here: [ABB Library](https://library.abb.com/)

This solution can be used to control a real robot or to simulate one. The Unity3D Digital-Twin application has been tested on the ABB CRB GoFa robotic arm, both on real hardware and in simulation.

The application can be installed on a mobile phone, tablet or computer, but for communication with the robot it is necessary to be in the same network.

**Notes:**

EGM (Externally Guided Motion) is an interface for ABB robots that allows smoothless control of the robotic arm from an external application (in our case it is a Unity3D developmentpPlatform ). The EGM can be used to transfer positions to the robot controller in either Joint/ Cartesian space. In our case it is the control of the robot using Cartesian coordinates.

```bash
The file "egm.proto" can be found in the installation folder of RobotWare. For example on Windows with RobotWare 7.6.1:
C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\ABB Industrial IT\Robotics IT\RobotWare\RobotControl_7.6.1\utility\Template\EGM
```

The Protobuf code generator can be used to generate code from a *.proto file into individual programming languages.
