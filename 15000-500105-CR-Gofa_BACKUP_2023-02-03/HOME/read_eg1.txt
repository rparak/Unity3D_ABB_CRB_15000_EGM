The three files eg1bas.sys, eg1prc.sys and eg1tol.sys are just an example of a DAP application.
The example shows how to use the DAP platform. The example can be loaded into the robot
(dap/) and then executed. 

The IO-configuration file eg1_eio.cfg and the program file eg1.pgf (loading eg1.mod) can be used as an example.

The EIO configuration are done either by loading(Load new parameters) eg1_eio.cfg from RSO or the GTPU. 

The SYS configuration are done either by loading(Load new parameters) eg1sys.cfg from RSO or the GTPU.
If you want to configure a system for Multi Move, use the cfg file called eg1sys_mms.cfg instead.
The RW option MultiTasking is required if theese configurations are loaded.

Some texts will appear on the TP when the example executes (wrap around).
This will help you to follow the order in which the user hooks are used.
